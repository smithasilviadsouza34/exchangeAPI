Currency Exchange and Discount Calculation
Description Develop a Spring Boot application that integrates with a third-party currency exchange API to retrieve real-time exchange rates. The application should calculate the total payable amount for a bill in a specified currency after applying applicable discounts. The application should expose an API endpoint that allows users to submit a bill in one currency and get the payable amount in another currency.
Requirements:
Third-Party API Integration:
Integrate with a currency exchange API, such as ExchangeRate-API or Open Exchange Rates, to get real-time currency exchange rates.
Use the API key (replace your-api-key in the URL below) to access exchange rates.
Example endpoint: https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/{base_currency}?apikey=your-api-key
https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/AEC?apikey=your-api-key
GET https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/7a10570dcb9f2142d5fc7f5e/latest/USD
Discounts and Currency Conversion Logic:
Apply discounts as per the following rules:
If the user is an employee of the store, they get a 30% discount.
If the user is an affiliate of the store, they get a 10% discount.
If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, they get a 5% discount.
For every $100 on the bill, there is a $5 discount.
The percentage-based discounts do not apply to groceries.
A user can get only one of the percentage-based discounts on a bill.
Convert the bill total from the original currency to the target currency using the retrieved exchange rates.
Calculate the final payable amount in the target currency after applying the applicable discounts.
Authentication:
Implement authentication for the exposed endpoints.
Endpoint Exposure:
Expose an API endpoint (/api/calculate) to accept bill details including items, their categories, total amount, user type, customer tenure, original currency, and target currency.
The endpoint should return the net payable amount in the specified target currency after applying applicable discounts and currency conversion.
Design and Testing:
Use object-oriented programming principles to design the application.
Provide a high-level UML class diagram of all key classes in your solution.
Write unit tests to achieve good code coverage, utilizing mocking frameworks where applicable.
Ensure code simplicity and adherence to modern coding practices.
Documentation:
Maintain a clear README.md that explains how the code and tests can be run and how coverage reports can be generated. Also mention which endpoint you integrated with.
Bonus Activities:
Create build scripts using Maven or Gradle to:
Build the project from the command line.
Run static code analysis such as linting.
Run unit tests and generate code coverage reports.
Generate a SonarQube report for the code quality summary.
Implement caching for exchange rates to reduce API calls.
Submission: Create a GitHub repository, ensure the name is generic and doesnâ€™t contain any company names. Commit your code to the GitHub repository and share the link with us.
Follow-up Discussion: After completing the exercise, be ready for a 15-minute discussion on your key decisions, assumptions, and rationale for your implementation.
